# Weather app

This is a simple and complete weather app where the user can:
* see city weather of the current location
* search for city
* see weather of today and the next 5 days
* see the date and location of the weather
* see according to image for each type of weather
* see the min and max degree each day
* see wind status and wind direction
* see humidity percentage
* see visibility indicator
* see air pressure number
* convert temperature in Celcius to Fahrenheit and vice versa

The project is created with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9. The template is developed with HTML, SCSS and Javascript. For the icons, we use [Material Design Icons] (https://google.github.io/material-design-icons/); data are taken from [MetaWeather API](https://www.metaweather.com/api/).

Weather App is a front-end coding challenge by [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/mM1UIenRhK808W8qmLWv).
